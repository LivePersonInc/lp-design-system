# LivePerson Design System

## Docs

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to create [LPDS docs and demos](https://livepersoninc.github.io/lp-design-system/)

## Developing

**LPDS is using Monorepo development strategy and [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) + [Yarn 3 Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) to work with it.**
