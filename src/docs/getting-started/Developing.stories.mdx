# Developing

If you want to run the project locally, its really easy!

The project uses Storybook for its demos and development environment.

### 1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LivePersonInc/lp-design-system.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Start DevServer

```bash
yarn start
```

Once started the browser will open to the storybook url.
From here you can see and try all things that LPDS provides

**Note:** you can run Storybook in docs mode by using `yarn start:docs` command
